                As i know so far, CSGO is a tactical shooter,
                hard based (mostly) on knowladge and team-play, many people think that you only need skill
                and you can carry all of your teammates versus 5 another players from another team, but,
                no one is "one man army",
                clutches and acese happen far more rare when you can expect them to happen, and many new players
                misunderstand all of gameplay of this game, so here we go. <br>
                I don't need to say here what we will analyse 16-Round MatchMaking (ab. MM) on Defusal Group and I will
                assume that you, guest on my site, have minimal understanding on main mechanics of this game and played
                at least one MM

                First thing what happen to you then you spawn before round start,
                is that you start with USP or Glock in your hand and some money in your wallet,
                of course you will want to buy something more powerfull like AWP, but how about other weapons...
                Where are 3 main group of them in the game: Pistols, Main (Rifle and Sniper Rifle), Farm (SMG and
                Shotguns):

                Some tips: <br>
                ---- <br>
                -> Cycle weapon (for exemple from main weapon to knife and back ) <br>
                to end recoil of weapon, there usefull then you lost control over an AK or Deagle <br>
                ---- <br>
                -> Try to relax and tap (shot one bullet at time) with your weapon <br>
                it's surprisingly usefull tip becouse many players start to panic as soon as they see enemy <br>
                ---- <br>
                -> Mostly every weapon will one shot in head the enemy without second kevlar <br>

                Note: <br>
                After Ragdoll update, every gun have slighty changed spray pattern, so pattern from below are not 100%

                Movment is esential to this game, you need to understand something here: <br>
                First of all you need to remember all of car racing game, and more exactly, Corner Cuttig <br>
                It will save you some time then you go to your position, 1 second or 10th of second, whatever <br>
                With this free time you can easily outrun enemy, and take them by surprise or buy some time for yourself
                if you are on CT side
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="flexcontainer ">
            <div class="textbox ">
                Beside that, if you don't have intel on enemies, try to bite on corners fastly moving beside it <br>
                If some enemy will check your position, no matter how high skill he or she is, a good bite can't be
                prefired or readed <br>
                And more importantly, enemy with high chances will shoot one your position, revealing himself by tracer
                or sound <br>
                So now you have intel on enemy location, well done
            </div>

        <div class="flexcontainer ">
            <div class="textbox ">
                Another form of movment is strafe, where a side velocity is combined with forewerd one what give you
                some bust in speed <br>
                most helpfull this one is for Corner Cuttig and Bunny Hopping
            </div>

        <div class="flexcontainer ">
            <div class="textbox ">
                Bunny Hopping is action there you rapidly jump, summing up speed from air acceleration and strafing <br>
                You can rapidly jump by binding mouse wheel for jump<br>
                Notice, that if you will fail you grip on jump you will lose acceleration and will be slowed for brief
                moment<br>
                BH is considerd very difficult movment technic, so don't worry very much about constantly loosing grip
                on jump

                Some tips for MM: <br>
                ---- <br>
                -> Don't use BH if you can't make 4 consequtive jumps frequently <br>
                ---- <br>
                -> MM has a velocity limiter what deny air strafe acceleration

                Beside everything that have been said above: <br>
                ---- <br>
                -> Try not to jump if you don't want to Cut a Corner or Bunny Hoop <br>
                ---- <br>
                -> MM has a velocity limiter what deny air strafe acceleration <br>
                ---- <br>
                -> When baiting, don't try to repeat this action in same rythm because enemy will read your next movment
                and prefire <br>
                ---- <br>
                and most classical one <br>
                -> Run with knife for maximum speed

                Smoke are most easiest utilitis to use, they are used mostly for bloking view on two or more sided
                position <br>
                On higher levels, smokes are used to stop T from pushing, becouse of mechanics of smoke in this game
                <br>
                Person that exit from smoke will see another from outside with delay but from outside, enemies will see
                without delay

                Flesh are most esentil utilitis in game, they are harder to master becouse they need to be thrown
                specialy so enemies will not see them fast enoght to react (to turn around from them) <br>
                Most basic flesh throw is to throw it stright up, this will flesh everyone who is not looking down <br>
                More advenced flesh is Corner flesh what is thrown with low strenght so it will fly slow enought to not
                be to loud, and to suprise enemies with "POP-flesh"

                HE (High Explosive) or how people name them 'nade, are used to damage enemys that are hiding behind the
                wall or obstacle <br>
                Nade's can be used to delay T-push, but I recommand to save nade's to later minutes of round <br>
                There they can save your life if you know there enemies are <br>

                Last granade in list is decoy granade, rarly used and prety much bought randomly becouse of small price
                of 50$ <br>
                Can be usefull to use against Pro player what try to read situation on the map and momentary turn around
                from flash granade <br>
                In this situation you can make an agressive push with decoy but it's very dangerous to do so becouse not

                There is one very simple rule, be quite, shift (move slowly) on all non start position <br>
                Try to find time to hold your postion and sense presence of enemys on the map <br>
                And most importantly, check your radar more often

                Well, first of all it's play-style of whole team, so <br>
                If there is someone who try to rebel in your team agains your team play style <br>
                you will not win a single game <br>
                Yes, this game is team-based, you need fullparty of 5 friends to win.

                An interest thing in this game are Fake's <br>
                This consist mainly from utility thrown on another site to disorient and missinform enemies <br>
                Which can lead to suprise push and advantage for (mostly) T side

            <div class="textbox ">
                So let's continue, there are common (economical one's) play-styles and some uniqu to CT and T sides:
                <br>
                Common: <br>
                ♻️ --- Eco --- ♻️ <br>
                Round there you don't buy anything to save money for later game <br>
                But i recommand to buy p250 becouse it's cheap and quite powerfull for 300$ <br>
                This kind of rounds are not meant to be won, and there is some common missunderstanding among many
                player <br>
                You need to play more passivly, becouse if you will rush on enemies without anything beside pistol,
                enemies will gain fast-income killing you <br>
                Be a rat, be a camper and don't be ashamed for doing so <br>
                ✊ --- Force --- ✊ <br>
                Round there your team don't have money for Rifle+Cevlar combo, so everyone are buying farmguns+kevlar
                <br>
                If your team is professiongal enoght, you can ignore "eco-round to fullbuy" setup <br> But be carefull,
                if you lose a force, your team will not have enought money even on SMG next round<br>
                🌀 --- Full-Buy --- 🌀 <br>
                Classical round, everyone have rifle+kevlar combo and additionaly, full granade stack and pistol <br>
                ½ --- Semi-Buy --- ½ <br>
                Typicle happen on non-full party <br>
                Someone in team have a full-buy but other teammates have money only for force, I don't recommand this
                kind of tactics <br>
                <br> CT: <br>
                === Counter-Push === <br>
                Round there CT try to capture positions of T, using utility and rush, doing so will probably take
                enemies by surprise, but, don't forget <br>
                If you are doing a stack counter-push (5 person push) you have 50/50 to not guess where terrorist are
                pushing (if they are doing so) B or A ? <br>
                and if doing solo push or with one-two teammates, you can end be overruned by stack of enemies <br>

                === Stack === <br>
                Round there CT guard only one site in 5, this is an risky tactic and is mainly used on eco rounds or
                more rarly seen on force rounds <br>
                What to say about it ? 50/50 chance to guess and if enemies have good intel, this chances go stright
                down to 0% <br>

                <br> T: <br>
                /// Rush \\\ <br>
                Simple as hello world, stack of 5 terrorists rush A or B site with minimal utility execute, <br>
                mainly executed wrong becouse of poor commuication between teammates <br>
                this play-style is most difficult to master, everyone need to be prepared to fast reaction, fast
                adaptation and improvisation on place, if someone in team will forgot or will do actions with
                minimal delay, everything will go wrong, I bet you it will <br>

                /// Execute \\\ <br>
                Sometimes stack, sometimes no, an push with smokes and molotovs to drawback enemies from camping
                positions and to free site to plant a bomb <br>
                Most classical play-style of terrorists, often paired with fake utility and fack pushes <br>

                /// Freeplay \\\ <br>
                Round there T spred across the map and are trying to find open-frags to open a sites <br>
                Mainly used on non-team party and casual servers of CSGO, not recommanded for MM <br>

                /// Lowbeats \\\ <br>
                Round there T hold position to last minute, similar to Freeplay with difference that
                Lowbeats are played more passivly <br>
                This kind of tactics is used on eco rounds or if CT have been pushing and
                counter-rushing very often <br>

                One thing about roles in team is that, they don't really exist <br>
                In a good team everyone can change their style based on that a team need: <br>
                <br>
                An good team need 4 main player and 1 sniper
                <br> or <br>
                5 players armed with farmguns on force rounds
                <br> or <br>
                On CT side, 3 main player and 2 sniper
