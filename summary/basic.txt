As i know so far, csgo is a tactical shooter,  
hard based (mostly) on knowladge and team-play, many people think that you only need skill
and you can carry all of your teammates versus 5 another players from another team, but, 
no one is "one man army" , 
clutches and acese happen far more rare when you can expect them to happen, and many new players
misunderstand all of gameplay of this game, so here we go.
